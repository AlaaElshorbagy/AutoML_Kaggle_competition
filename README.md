# Supervised Learning Challenge - Auto ML 

This notebook was created as part of a supervise learning challenge on a private Kaggle competition hosted by Constructor Learning. 

**Dataset Overview**

The dataset consists of two CSV files: 'features' and 'target'. The 'features' file contains rows representing 'measurements', and each column represents a 'feature'. Corresponding class labels for each row in 'features' are provided in the 'target' file. The row numbers can be considered as unique keys.

**Challenge Objectives**

Implementing machine learning models using the labeled 'train' data to predict the class labels for the 'test' data. 
**Evaluation**

The primary evaluation metric is the f1_macro score in scikit-learn.

**Results** 
Ranked 6# out of 36 participants.
